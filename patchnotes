Alpha v1.0.0


+ Welcome message redone, will now randomly pick from 7 different messages for a bit of variety.
+ Ban leave message redone, will now show a neat little GIF to go along with the ban message!
+ Leave message completely redone from scratch, will now give a unique message depending on what follower role the user has.
+ New member logs, now tags the account that joined and has a much more readable date.
+ Message deletion logs, tags the user so moderators can find their profile faster.
+ Message edit logs, jump to message clickable link to be directed straight to the edited message.
+ Balance command redone, now gives a 'wealth status' depending on how much money you have! Also corresponds with your role colour.
+ Shop command, browse through the military market and buy an item of choice, who knows, they may give boosts or exclusive content when used!
